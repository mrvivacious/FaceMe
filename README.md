# FaceMe
How would I feel if this social media post faced me?

Chrome extension that <strong>somehow encourages you to review your post if it contains questionable language, to be implemented </strong>

### How to deploy

Go to chrome://extensions in Chrome and turn on "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
